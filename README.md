# Wikipedia Viewer

Welcome to the Wikipedia Viewer! This is a legacy project under the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the Front-End Developer Track. This JavaScript app allows users to search for information using the Media Wiki API. Users can also redirect to random articles by clicking the link “View a Random Article” in the app. You can view the project here: [https://antofon.github.io/wikipediaviewer/](https://antofon.github.io/wikipediaviewer/)
